# Covid-19 Detection using Transfer learning from CT Scans and X-ray images 
COVID-19 Detection based on Chest X-rays and CT Scans using three Transfer Learning algorithms: VGG16, InceptionV3, Xception. The models were trained for 50 epochs on around 800 Chest X-rays and around 750 CT Scan images on Google Colab GPU. In future we try to use the best alogrithm and try to make our model optimised
